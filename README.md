# Amazon-Sales-Dashboard

This dashboard is designed to make sense of huge amounts of data in an easy and visually appealing way. It focuses on three key areas:

1️⃣ Amazon: Displays different product categories for a quick and clear overview.

2️⃣ Amazon Fashion: Highlights products specifically from the fashion category to understand trends and preferences.

3️⃣ Sales: Tracks key sales metrics like total sales, units sold, and sales trends by cities and states.

The purpose of creating this dashboard is to help businesses or individuals analyze their data in a meaningful way—whether it’s understanding which products are performing well, which areas have the highest sales, or spotting trends over time.

I’ve used Power BI for this project, and my goal was to make the data more accessible and actionable.
